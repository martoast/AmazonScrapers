# AmazonScrapers
AmazonScrapers is a collection of web scraping tools designed to help Amazon sellers gather data that can be used to improve their product offerings and sales strategies. 

To use the scrapers, you will need a CSV file that contains a list of Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs) for the products you want to scrape. The scrapers will use these ASINs to perform a search on Amazon and extract pricing data for the used buy box, new buy box, and list price.

After the data has been scraped, it will be written to a new CSV file that you can use for further analysis or import into other tools. The scrapers are designed to be easy to use and can be customized to meet your specific needs.

Whether you're a new Amazon seller looking to optimize your pricing strategy or an experienced seller looking for new ways to gather data and gain insights, AmazonScrapers provides a powerful set of tools that can help you succeed in the competitive world of e-commerce.
